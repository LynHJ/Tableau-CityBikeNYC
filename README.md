## Background

This report aims to help our shareholders to uncover two phenomena and make some recommendations. The data was sourced from https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data., and its timeframe ranging from 06.22 to 09.22 was a summer season in America.  


## Data
There are 4 csv files records citybike renting data from 06.22 to 09.22. The data sets had been  transfromed and load into one csv file (CityBike-tripdata-0622-0922.csv) by using <s>CityBike.ipynb</s>. As the data size is too large. So please use the LINK <code>https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vA58GviA-OZAeJTvbioiRiS8CuHLHZUY?usp=sharing</code> to look into the data and the tableau file.  

### Report
<code>Citi Bike Analysis Report.pdf</code>will cover all what I find from the data set. There are two dashboards presenting two phenomena respectively and two city official maps(start station and end station). Each item comes with analysis.  
    
### Summary:

Overall, the business is gradually growing, the number of bike stations is increasing and the area of using our services is expanding. It is a good sign for our company. However, we still need to plan ahead to deal with unpredictable situations that happen when the business scales up.  

I have made three recommendations. Firstly, comprehensively upgrade our network systems and hardware equipment to provide our customer better service quality. Secondly, modifying our existed renting rule to stop people rent our bikes more than 1 day a trip, which could help us cost down efficiently. Lastly, we could build up a relationship with the ferry company or bus companies to strengthen the importance of our bike business in the traffic network.
